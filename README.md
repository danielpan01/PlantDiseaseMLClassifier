![PlantDiseaseML](https://cdn.britannica.com/89/126689-004-D622CD2F/Potato-leaf-blight.jpg)

## Overview

This repository contains the code for a machine learning project focused on the automated identification of plant diseases using neural networks. The primary model used is a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier, trained on the PlantVillage dataset. The project demonstrates the potential of neural networks in enhancing agricultural diagnostics by providing a scalable solution for early disease detection.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Resize, normalize, and prepare images for model training.
- **MLP Model Training:** Train a Multi-layer Perceptron classifier with hyperparameter tuning.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate model performance using accuracy, confusion matrices, and loss curves.
- **Deep Learning Comparison:** Compare the MLP model with a deep learning model based on the CLIP architecture.

## Getting Started
